#Purpose

This program is structured around a custom ADT defined as a List. This particular
List is almost identical to a doubley linked list, with many added manipulation and access functions
for ease of navigation. The List contains Node ADT's as well to store data, primarily in the form of
integers. Lex.c sorts a file alphabetically, based on the insertion sort algorithm, and outputs the newly
formed list to a specified output file.


#Build

Important Commands:

$make all:
	Executes neccesary makefile commands to create the main executable : Lex (gcc).

#Run

-Run the executable "Lex" with two program arguments:
	./Lex <inputfile.txt> <outputfile.txt>
